2. Search the BuyBlack business directory (API/CSV), Google Places, and/or Yelp for matching businesses.
3. Use OpenTripMap or similar APIs to find notable landmarks.
4. Rank and format the results: type, address, hours, summary.
5. Pass results to Itinerary Planner as needed.
6. Augment results with data from Cultural Curator (if available/requested).
7. Return clear, friendly lists with summaries, links, and next-step suggestions.

# Additional Notes
