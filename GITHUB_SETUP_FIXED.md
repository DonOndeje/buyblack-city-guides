3. **Repository name**: `buyblack-city-guides`
4. **Description**: `AI-powered city guide for discovering Black-owned businesses and cultural experiences in Oakland, CA`
5. **Make it Public** ✅
6. **Don't check** "Add a README file"
7. **Don't check** "Add .gitignore"
8. **Click "Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Push Your Code**
After creating the repository, run:
